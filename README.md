This is a project for freecodecamp.org.  I decided against what was mentioned not to have a single repo for each project as
I work in github on a daily basis and don't want to manage many code basis.

Currently the following projects are being done here:
>Timestamp Microservice Complete
>Request Header Parser Microservice Complete 
>URL Shortener Microservice Complete  
>Image Search Abstraction Layer Incomplete

7 more projects after this.  All of it is hosted in server.js currently.
